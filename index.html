      Hey every one. My name is Kermit Bonner im a fourth generation Kermit.
      Every one I know calls me Chris or Kerm tho. I am an aspireing developer.
      I have a 2 year old daughter named Charlie. She is the main reason I am
      pursuing a career in web development. I have a background in customer
      facing and sales. I bring a technical background to a professional
      salesman. I can interact with any customer, speak with large groups and
      able to interact well with a development team.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a major passion for anything copetitive. I think that's what made
      me such a good salesman. I love just about all professional sports
      expecillay football and baseball. I'm a avid fantasy football nut. I stay
      up to date with as many video games as possible.
